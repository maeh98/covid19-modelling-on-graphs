# How to Model Epidemics, and the efficacy of state intervention, using Graphs and Differential Equations. 2020-2021
I presentated how and in which way graphs can be used to mathematically model natural and social dynamics. 
I explained in particular how a specific family of graphs, the Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs),
were being used in research in the epidemiological modelling of the first Covid waves. Furthermore, I explained the attempts in research to model
the efficacy of state interventions on social interactions when trying to curb the spread of the virus.
I based most of my research on: "Not all interventions are equal for the height of the
second peak" by Jorritsma et al. (2020).
